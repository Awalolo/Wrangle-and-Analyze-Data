# WeRateDogs

## Introduction

This project reports the data wrangling process conducted on the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, 
also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous 
comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. 

Three major steps were conducted to achieve the wrangling process. The steps are as follows: 

* Data Gathering
* Data Assessing
* Data Cleaning

## Conclusion

After assessing and cleaning the dataset the following can be concluded:

* Twitter for iPhones was the major source for tweeting for both favorite and retweet counts.
* Favorite and retweet counts are highly correlated.
* The golden retriever has a significantly high tweet value


# Limitation

* Most of the dog names were not captured in the dataset
* Some dogs have multiple stages
* Most columns in the dataset had null values
